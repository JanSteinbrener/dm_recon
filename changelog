Changelog of the dm_recon reconstruction algorithm		 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apr 19th, 2010 (JFS)
	- fixed problem with setting of the global phase in dm_recon_average.

Mar 29th, 2010 (JFS)
	- changed tagnames for shrinkwrap in scriptfile to shrink start,
	shrink end to make it more obvious that the end points are
	included. Also fixed wrong use of modulus constraint to calculate
	the next iteration at which averaging should occur.
	
Jan 12th, 2010 (JFS)
	- fixed wrong implementation of positivity constraint for HIO. 

Aug 7th (JFS)
	- added possibility to start with previously saved iterate as
	starting guess
	
Jun 23rd (JFS)
	- added possibility to save iterates before averaging in 2D. 

Jun 19th (JFS)
	- added check if comments exist. Will create comments if they don't
	exist and print warning that no comments were found.
	
May 1st (JFS)
	- tested averaging, shrinkwrapping and positivity
	- updated comments to show if HIO or DM was used.
	
Apr 30th (JFS)
	- added HIO. Can be selected by setting HIO=1 in script 
	- moved error calc, averaging and shrinkwrapping into 
	the reconstruction routines

Apr 29th (JFS)
	- fixed problem with wrong starting guess. Now the total power 
	in starting guess is the same as in the measured magnitudes.
	- removed some HDF5 debug output from shrinkwrap routine

Apr 14th (JFS)
	- fixed bug with creating support array. It was not working
	properly with MPI.
	
	
Mar 14th (JFS)
	- shrinkwrap now directly loads fft-centered gaussian.
	
Jan 28th (JFS)
	- fixed problem with reading in values for averaging and shrinkwrap.
	If it says yes but avg/shrink_after is greater than number of iterations
	then avg/shrink_every will be set to 0.
	
Jan 27th (JFS)
	- dm_recon_crop_2d_adi now uses dm_array_crop_2d_real

Jan 23rd (JFS)
	- added new function dm_recon_average that will set the global phase
	according to Chapman, JOSAA 2006 before averaging.
	
Jan 22nd (JFS)
	- renamed next_itn_cas to final_itn_cas and opt_next_itn_cas to 
	opt_itn_cas. Saved to the file is wither final_itn_cas or 
	avg_final_itn_cas if there is averaging. For diffmap final_itn_cas 
	is the Fourier estimate.
	
Jan 20th (JFS)
	- added this changelog and the script file for running several 
	reconstructions in a row to CVS
	- error calculation now performed by external routine. It can be used
	for all reconstruction algorithms. It is the ratio of total power 
	outside of support to total power within support.
